Still Learning How to use Tkinter. 

Future Changes: 
  - Save changes: I want to add something that will allow me to reopen the program and it save everything I had.
  - Make it look nicer: look at ways to make the buttons and text look better and look into how to make it more personallised

I assume no one will see my stuff but if you do know that I am still learning this stuff and dont care if it sucks or not.
My full progress of all projects will be posted on Git for future use and learning.
